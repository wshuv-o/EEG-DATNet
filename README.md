# BCI-EEG: EEG Data Processing for Brain-Computer Interface

This repository contains code and resources for processing EEG data for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications using a novel deep learning model. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of EEG signal classification for real-time BCI tasks.

## üß† Overview

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method to record brain activity. In this project, we process EEG data and classify mental tasks using a novel machine learning model designed specifically for BCI applications. The model is optimized for handling noisy, high-dimensional, and temporally sensitive EEG signals.

## üîç Objectives

- Preprocess raw EEG data for noise reduction and artifact removal.
- Extract meaningful features from multichannel EEG signals.
- Train and evaluate a novel model for classifying EEG signals.
- Enable real-time or near real-time decision-making for BCI systems.

## üöÄ Features

- EEG signal preprocessing (filtering, normalization, artifact removal)
- Feature extraction using both classical and deep learning techniques
- Novel model architecture for enhanced classification performance
- Evaluation using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualization of EEG signals and classification results
