# BCI-EEG: EEG Data Processing for Brain-Computer Interface

This repository contains code and resources for processing EEG data for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications using a novel deep learning model. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of EEG signal classification for real-time BCI tasks.

## 🧠 Overview

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method to record brain activity. In this project, we process EEG data and classify mental tasks using a novel machine learning model designed specifically for BCI applications. The model is optimized for handling noisy, high-dimensional, and temporally sensitive EEG signals.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Preprocess raw EEG data for noise reduction and artifact removal.
- Extract meaningful features from multichannel EEG signals.
- Train and evaluate a novel model for classifying EEG signals.
- Enable real-time or near real-time decision-making for BCI systems.

## 🚀 Features

- EEG signal preprocessing (filtering, normalization, artifact removal)
- Feature extraction using both classical and deep learning techniques
- Novel model architecture for enhanced classification performance
- Evaluation using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualization of EEG signals and classification results

# NeuroTransNet: EEG Signal Analysis Using Neural Networks

## Overview
NeuroTransNet is a deep learning-based model designed for EEG (Electroencephalography) signal analysis. It leverages advanced neural network techniques, including hybrid architectures and attention mechanisms, to process and classify EEG signals, with applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), health diagnostics, and cognitive state monitoring.

This repository provides code and guidelines for setting up the environment, running experiments, and evaluating the performance of the NeuroTransNet model in EEG signal classification tasks.

## Key Features

- EEG Signal Classification: Preprocesses and classifies EEG signals into meaningful categories such as cognitive states or health conditions.
- Hybrid Neural Network Architecture: Utilizes a Classical -> Quantum -> Classical architecture for efficient signal processing.
- Dual Attention Mechanism: Focuses on relevant parts of the EEG signal to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
- Customizable: Can be adapted to various EEG datasets for different research and clinical applications.
